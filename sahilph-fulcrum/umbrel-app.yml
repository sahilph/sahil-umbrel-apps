tagline: A fast & nimble SPV server, drop-in replacement for ElectronX/ElectrumX
description: >-
  Run your personal Electrum server and connect your Electrum-compatible wallet,
  including BitBoxApp, BlueWallet, Electrum Wallet (Android and Desktop), Nunchuk 
  (Desktop), Phoenix, and Sparrow Wallet to it instead of using a third-party
  Electrum server.

  Highlights:
  
    - *Fast:* Written in 100% modern `C++20` using multi-threaded and asynchronous programming techniques.
    
    - *A drop-in replacement for ElectronX/ElectrumX:* Fulcrum is 100% protocol-level compatible with the [Electrum Cash 1.5.3 protocol](https://electrum-cash-protocol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Existing server admins should feel right at home with this software since installation and management of it is nearly identical to ElectronX/ElectrumX server.
